# contaminate
Approximately 10 million tons of toxic chemicals are released by industries every year into our air, land, and water. Contaminate is an app allowing the in-depth walk-through of users of the pollution in our environment. The app allows users to navigate through natural and human-inhabitated environments, witnessing and identifying the negative effects of environmental pollution. Contaminate offers users a simulation of past, current, and projected states of environmental pollution to demonstrate horrendous future if we don't take immediate action. Users will be able to find checkpoints near areas of contamination or environmental harm in the scene, showing them more facts and ways they can make a change. This will increase awareness of pollution in our environment and cause momentum among individuals to make a change to save our planet.

An app that allows users a simulation through natural environments and human-habitated areas affected by pollution. 
Designed to have three worlds, each displaying pollution unique to that area : European forest affected by chemical pollution, coral reef affected by plastics and global warming, and city affected by air pollution.
Each world has a mode for the past, present, and future states of these places to show the effects of pollution over time. 
The user will need to visit checkpoints before moving on the the next mode or world. 
The user will be able to save their progress for the next time they open the app. 
The user will have access to additional information and ways to improve the environment at each checkpoint.
The user will be able to create their own list or plan of steps they will take to reduce contamination - for example: changing an everyday habit that harms the environment such as throwing contacts down the drain. 

This project was recently used for the 2019 Technovation Challenge, although not in it's completed form.
